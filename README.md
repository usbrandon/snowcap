Snowcap helps you provision, deploy, and secure resources in Snowflake. Datacoves takes it further: a managed DataOps platform for dbt and Airflow where governance and best practices are built into every layer.

- **Private cloud or SaaS** – your data, your choice
- **Managed dbt + Airflow** – production-ready from day one
- **In-browser VS Code** – onboard developers in minutes
- **Bring your own tools** – integrates with your existing stack, no lock-in
- **AI-assisted development** – connect your organization's approved LLM (Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure, Gemini, and more)
- **Built-in governance** – CI/CD, guardrails, and best practices included

Snowcap is the power tools. Datacoves is the workshop.

| Templating / loops | ✅ | ✅ | Limited | ❌ |
| Export existing resources | ✅ | Import only | ❌ | ❌ |
| Actively maintained | ✅ Datacoves | ✅ Snowflake | ⚠️ Single maintainer | ⚠️ Infrequent |

## Key Features

- **Declarative** — Generates the right SQL to make your config match your account
- **Comprehensive** — 60+ Snowflake resource types supported
- **Flexible** — Write configuration in YAML or Python
- **Fast** — 50%+ faster than Terraform and Permifrost

## Quick Start

Run with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (no install needed):

```sh
uvx snowcap plan --config snowcap.yml
```

Or install from PyPI:

```sh
pip install snowcap
```

Create `snowcap.yml`:

```yaml
warehouses:
  - name: analytics
    warehouse_size: xsmall
    auto_suspend: 60
```

Run:

```sh
# Set credentials
export SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT=my-account
export SNOWFLAKE_USER=my-user
export SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=my-password
export SNOWFLAKE_ROLE=SYSADMIN

# Preview changes

## Background

Snowcap is a fork of [Titan Core](https://github.com/Titan-Systems/titan). The original project appeared unmaintained, so Datacoves forked it to continue active development, fix bugs, and add new features. We're grateful to the Titan Systems team for creating and open-sourcing the original project under the Apache 2.0 license.
